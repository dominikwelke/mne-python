=======================================
Basic analysis of an SSVEP/vSSR dataset
=======================================

In this tutorial we compute the frequency spectrum and quantify signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) at a target frequency in EEG data recorded during fast periodic
visual stimulation (FPVS).
Extracting SNR at stimulation frequency is a simple way to quantify frequency
tagged responses in MEEG (a.k.a. steady state visually evoked potentials,
SSVEP, or visual steady-state responses, vSSR in the visual domain,
or auditory steady-state responses, ASSR in the auditory domain).

DATA:

We use a simple example dataset with frequency tagged visual stimulation:
N=2 participants observed checkerboards patterns inverting with a constant
frequency of either 12Hz of 15Hz. 10 trials of 20s length each.
32ch wet EEG was recorded.

Data can be downloaded at https://osf.io/7ne6y/
Data format: BrainVision .eeg/.vhdr/.vmrk files organized according to BIDS
standard.

OUTLINE:

- We will visualize both the PSD and the SNR spectrum of our epoched data.

- We will extract SNR at stimulation frequency for all trials and channels.

- We will show, that we can statistically separate 12hz and 15 hz responses
  in our data.


Since the evoked response is mainly generated in early visual areas of the
brain we will stick with an ROI analysis and extract SNR from occipital
channels.

# Data preprocessing
# ------------------
# Due to a generally high SNR in SSVEP/vSSR, typical preprocessing steps
# are considered optional. This doesn't mean, that a proper cleaning would not
# increase your signal quality!
#
# * Raw data have FCz reference, so we will apply common-average rereferencing.
#
# * We will apply a 50 Hz notch filter to remove line noise,
#
# * and a 0.1 - 250 Hz bandpass filter.
#
# * Lastly, we will cut the data in 20 s epochs corresponding to the trials.

# Frequency analysis
# ------------------
# Now we compute the frequency spectrum of the EEG data.
# You will already see the peaks at the stimulation frequencies and some of
# their harmonics, without any further processing.
#
# The 'classical' PSD plot will be compared to a plot of the SNR spectrum.
# SNR will be computed as a ratio of the power in a given frequency bin
# to the average power in its neighboring bins.
# This procedure has two advantages over using the raw PSD:
#
# * it normalizes the spectrum and accounts for 1/f power decay.
#
# * power modulations which are not very narrow band will disappear.
#
# Calculate power spectral density (PSD)
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# We use Welch's method for frequency decomposition, since it is really fast.
# We chose a frequency resolution of 0.1 hz.
# You could compare it with, e.g., multitaper to get an impression of the
# influence on SNR. All the other methods implemented in MNE can be used as
# well.

# to a 'noise' baseline - the average power in the surrounding frequency bins.
#
# Hence, we need to set some parameters for this baseline - how many
# neighboring bins should be taken for this computation, and do we want to skip
# the direct neighbors (this can make sense if the stimulation frequency is not
# super constant, or frequency bands are very narrow).

# You can see that the peaks at the stimulation frequencies (12 hz, 15 hz)
# and their harmonics are visible in both plots.
# Yet, the SNR spectrum shows them more prominently as peaks from a
# noisy but more or less constant baseline of SNR = 1.
# You can further see that the SNR processing removes any broad-band power
# differences (such as the increased power in alpha band around 10 hz),
# and also removes the 1/f decay in the PSD.
#
# Note, that while the SNR plot implies the possibility of values below 0
# (mean minus sd) such values do not make sense.
# Each SNR value is a ratio of positive PSD values, and the lowest possible PSD
# value is 0 (negative Y-axis values in the upper panel only result from
# plotting PSD on a log scale).
# Hence SNR values must be positive and can minimally go towards 0.
# You can nicely see this at 50hz with the artifact induced by notch
# filtering the line noise:
# The PSD spectrum shows a prominent negative peak and average SNR approaches
# 0.

# frequency, but we also want to restrict the analysis to a spatial ROI. The
# most interesting questions, however, will probably rely on comparing SNR in
# different trials.
#
# Since we here have a large SNR array with all conditions, we will have to
# find the indices of trials, channels, etc.

#
# Such a topography plot can be a nice tool to explore and play with your data
# - e.g. you could try how changing the reference will affect the spatial
# distribution of SNR values.
#
# However, we also wanted to show this plot to point at a potential
# problem with frequency-tagged (or any other brain imaging) data:
# there are many channels and somewhere you will likely find some
# statistically significant effect.
# It is very easy - even unintended - to end up double-dipping or p-hacking.
# So if you want to work with an ROI or individual channels, ideally select
# them *a priori* - before collecting or looking at the data - and preregister
# this decision so people will believe you.
# If you end up selecting an ROI or individual channel for reporting *because
# this channel or ROI shows an effect*, e.g. in an explorative analysis, this
# is also fine but make it transparently and correct for multiple comparison.

# Debriefing
# ----------
# So that's it, we hope you enjoyed our little tour through this example
# dataset.
#
# As you could see, frequency-tagging is a very powerful tool that can yield
# very high signal to noise ratios and effect sizes that enable you to detect
# brain responses even within a single participant and single trials of only
# a few seconds duration.
#
# Bonus exercises
# ---------------
# For the overly motivated amongst you, let's see what else we can show with
# these data.
#
# Using Welch's method as implemented in MNE makes it very easy to change
# the amount of data that is actually used in the spectrum
# estimation. We can tweak both the length of the actual trial, and the length
# of the Welch window.
#
# Here we employ this to show you some features of frequency
# tagging data that you might or might not have already intuitively expected:
#
# Effect of trial duration on SNR
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# First we will simulate shorter trials by taking the first x s of our 20s

# that covers the entire epoch:

# perspectives:
# For the first plot we kept the entire 20s of data, but changed the length
# of the Welch window.
# For the second plot we fixed the Welch window, and again simulated different
# trial lengths.

# In these plots you can see that a shorter Welch window (relative to the
# amount of data) leads not only to lower SNR values (as described above)
# but also to lower variance / higher confidence in the means.
#
# This is the very idea of Welch's method, and is relevant to remember when
# you decide for your analysis parameters:
#
# there is no such thing as an optimal welch window, its always a tradeoff:
# a longer Welch window results in higher average SNR values;
# a shorter window results in lower values but is more robust /
# there is a higher confidence in the mean.
#
# Yet, one should also not pick too small a window: in our data we can see
# that the very short Welch windows < 2-3s are not great -
# here we've hit the noise bottom.
#
# Time resolved SNR
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# ..and finally we can trick MNE's PSD implementation to make it a
# sliding window analysis and come up with a time resolved SNR measure.
# This will reveal whether a participant blinked or scratched their head..
